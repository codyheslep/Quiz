# Boilermaker

## Setup

To use this boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

* Don't fork or clone this repo! Instead, create a new, empty directory on your machine and `git init` (or create an empty repo on Github and clone it to your local machine)
* Run the following commands:

```
git remote add boilermaker https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker.git
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

```
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

Now that you've got the code, follow these steps to get acclimated:

* Update project name and description in `package.json` and `.travis.yml` files
* `npm install`, or `yarn install` - whatever you're into

  ```
    process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 'hush hush'
    process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = 'pretty secret'
    process.env.GOOGLE_CALLBACK = '/auth/google/callback'
  ```
## Start

`npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.
